# customer-segmentation
In the commercial market, several companies generate a significant amount of data. This vast database of customer transactions must be analyzed to design profitable strategies. Seeing that the majority of customers have different needs (what they do, how they buy, when they buy, how much money they have…). So with this increase in orders, it is difficult to understand the requirements of each customer. For this, in this project, we will create customer segments using the RFM method, which will be used to: 
• Recognize the best customers. 
• Identify our loyal customers. 
• Know which customers are about to unsubscribe. 
• When and how to develop new products. 
• The right time to run ads and promotions
