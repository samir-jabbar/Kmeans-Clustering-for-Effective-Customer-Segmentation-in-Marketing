![Customer Segmentation Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/repo/raw/main/dashboard.png)

## Introduction

In the world of commercial enterprises, companies accumulate vast amounts of customer data. This data can be a goldmine for understanding customer behavior, making informed decisions, and designing profitable strategies. However, with a multitude of customers, it becomes challenging to comprehend their individual needs and preferences. This is where customer segmentation comes into play.

Customer segmentation is the practice of categorizing customers into distinct groups based on various attributes such as their purchasing behavior, recency of transactions, frequency of purchases, and monetary value. One popular method for customer segmentation is the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method. RFM segmentation helps businesses to:

1. **Recognize the Best Customers:** Identifying the top customers who contribute the most to your business's revenue.

2. **Identify Loyal Customers:** Recognizing those customers who consistently engage with your business.

3. **Predict Customer Churn:** Finding customers who might be on the verge of unsubscribing or disengaging from your products or services.
